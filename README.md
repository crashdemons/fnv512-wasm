## Build Requirements
 - emcc (Emscripten) or clang++
 - updated C++11 libraries/includes

## Building the project yourself

 - run make to generate the tests, or ./make-wasm.sh to generate the JS loader and WASM
 - note: fnv512-wasm.js is a barebones emscripten loader for the WASM Module.  fnv512-wrapped.js automatically loads and sets up a JS Object with more useful methods to you.
